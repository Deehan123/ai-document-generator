# AI-Based Automated Document Generator

## Overview
This project aims to develop an AI-powered web application that automates the generation and distribution of personalized documents such as certificates from large datasets.

The system allows users to upload structured data (Excel/CSV), select or design templates, and generate personalized PDF documents in bulk. If email addresses are provided, the system can automatically send the generated PDFs to individual recipients.

## Problem Statement
Manually creating personalized certificates or documents for a large number of users is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient. Educational institutions and organizations require an automated solution to handle bulk document generation and distribution.

## Proposed Solution
The proposed system automates the entire workflow by:
- Accepting Excel/CSV files as input
- Allowing users to select or design document templates
- Generating personalized PDFs simultaneously
- Sending documents individually via email (optional)

This reduces manual effort and improves efficiency and accuracy.
